# ReadonlyREST API ([Enterprise](https://readonlyrest.com/enterprise))

As an Enterprise user, you can benefit from automating the security configuration changes without the need to reboot the ES cluster.

Every request is **validated against ROR syntax first**, and rejected if syntactically or semantically incorrect. This adds to the safety of each change operation.
