# Writing Test Settings

For impersonation to work, some valid Test Settings should be created and saved. It's important that the main ROR setting will be unaffected, so you, as an admin/user don't need to worry that you will break something. Here is how to write test settings:

1. Open the ROR menu
1. Click the Edit security settings button

    ![Test settings ror menu](<../../.gitbook/assets/test_settings_ror_menu.png>)

1. Go into the Test settings tab
1. You can set the "time to live" (TTL), that is a time interval after which the test settings will be automatically deactivated and impersonation session will also abruptly exit
1. You can load current settings as test settings
1. You can deactivate settings manually
1. You can save test settings as settings

    ![test settings tab](<../../.gitbook/assets/test_settings_tab.png>)
