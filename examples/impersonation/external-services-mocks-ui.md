# External services mocks configuration

External services mock is used to simulate the response of existing authentication or authorization service like LDAP.
You don't need to create a user account for configuration testing.
You will only need to define users (and their associated groups) that would normally be returned by the external services, listed in test settings.

After clicking add/edit user buttons (5), you will see a dialog with an option to add (6) or remove (7) user from external service mock
